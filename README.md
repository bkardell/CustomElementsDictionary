# CustomElementsData
Thinking about how we can collect and do useful things with information about custom elements

The idea here is to collect data and information about custom elements in the wild and their use.  There is a [report generated from the HTTPArchive](https://discuss.httparchive.org/t/use-of-custom-elements-with-attributes/1592) which contains csv data counting each dasherized element name that appears in the dataset and the attributes attributes attached to that.

The idea here is to create a space to collaboratively analyze that data and provide helpful or useful insights that link these to their possible or definitive sources, their licenses (if applicable) and attach other various metadata about them.  This could be useful to help drive future standardization, or just to help people find potentially useful custom elements and guage something about how reviewed they are and so on.
